# Movie Tinder

## About

This project was done in a code challenge request. 
The app is like a movie app where the user can see random movies in the movie wall and decide if he like it or dislike it. In the favorites page the user can see all liked movies and in the wall of shame he can see all disliked movies. 
Also is possible to search movies and apply the same like/dislike logic.
